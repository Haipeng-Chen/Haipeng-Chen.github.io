            <h3 class="mb-4">Research Overview</h3>
            <p>My primary research interests lie in the general areas of Artificial Intelligence, including Machine Learning, 
		    Data Mining, Multi-Agent Systems and Algorithmic Game Theory, with an emphasis of AI for Social Good. 
		    I have strong interests in the mathematical and algorithmic aspects of the AI methodologies. I am 
		    fascinated at AI methods with simple and yet insightful theoretical grounds. Besides the technical aspects
		    of AI, I am also interested in their intersections with various application domains such as Cybersecurity,
		    Intelligent Transportation, Network science, and Operations Research, which makes my research highly 
		    interdisciplinary. My research is usually motivated and driven by specific and practical problems that 
		    are encountered in the real-world. I am keen in seeking concise and representative models to formalize the
		    newly-encountered problems, and finding solutions to the formalized problems which are practically 
		    effective, efficient, robust, and scalable, while being theoretically well-grounded and simple in nature. 
		    My final goal is to generalize the developed solutions so that they are beyond the specific scenarios, 
		    and push a bit forward the edge of the techniques being employed.</p>
	    <p> Due to the interdisciplinary and problem-driven nature of my research, I have research experiences in highly 
		    broad areas of AI, including <b><i>Machine/Deep Learning</i></b> (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent 
		    Learning, Ensemble Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Deep Generative Models), <b><i>Data Mining</b></i> 
		    (e.g., graph/network data, web data, textual data, time series data, and multi-modal data), 
		    <b><i>Multi-Agent Systems</b></i>, and <b><i>Algorithmic Game Theory</b></i>. I always liked the new 
		    challenges brought by the new problems. At the same time, I enjoyed discovering the similarities between 
		    the distinct problems. I believe that <u>the key of solving a new problem with the right AI techniques is 
		    to understand the problem's mathematics nature in the first place.</u> Throughout my Ph.D. and postdoc, 
		    I have enjoyed working with domain experts as well as students from distinct research areas. I believe 
		    that <u>getting constant feedback and advice from domain experts is a key to understanding the mathematics 
		    nature of a newly-encountered problem.</u> Through my past research collaborations, I have gained extremely
		    valuable experiences in working with other researchers, as well as an extensively broadened scope of 
		    research in AI.</p>

		      <p>Nowadays, governments face a worsening problem of traffic congestion in urban areas. To alleviate road congestion, a number of approaches have been proposed, among which ETC has been reported to be effective in many countries and areas (e.g., <a href="https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltaweb/en/roads-and-motoring/managing-traffic-and-congestion/electronic-road-pricing-erp.html">Singapore ERP</a>, and <a href="http://www.autopass.no/en/autopass">Norway AutoPASS</a>).
The tolls of different roads and time periods are different, so that the vehicles are indirectly regulated to travel through less congested roads with lower tolls.
However, although current ETC schemes vary tolls at different time periods throughout a day, they are predetermined and fixed at the same periods from day to day.</p>
                      <p>To make the tolling fully dynamic, adaptive and optimized, we handle the dynamic tolling from a city scale, and model the dynamics of a tolling road systems as a high-dimensional Markov Decision Process (MDP).

                      <br>The state of the formulated MDP is the number of vehicles on a road that are heading to certain destination, and the action is the toll on each road. Our solution to the formulated MDP is characterized by the following properties (see Figure 1 as an illustration):

                      <p class="mb-3">In complex multiagent systems, sequential decision making has long been a significant challenge with many characteristics. One prominent characteristic is the <i>interactions</i> among the agents. In many practical scenarios (e.g., the Stag-Hunt game), agents need to <i>cooperate</i> with each other to achieve a common goal with high rewards (e.g., hunting stags), while each individual agent is <i>self-interested</i> and might deviate from the cooperation for less risky goals with low rewards (e.g., hunting rabbits). Another critical characteristic comes from various <i>uncertainties</i>. One type of uncertainty arises from the lack of accurate knowledge of environment and other agents where the uncertain information can be modelled probabilistically. A more challenging type of uncertainty lies in the environment-related factors which we do not know how to model.</p>

                      <p class="mb-3"> These two challenges are significantly amplified when it comes to sequential decision making, where we need to look at not only short term rewards but also rewards in the long run. Therefore, one has to consider subsequent effect of the current action, especially in a dynamic environment. Another crucial characteristic is the limited learning trials. On the Minecraft platform, it usually takes several seconds to complete one episode of game. Therefore, it is extremely time consuming to learn an effective policy. </p>

                      <p class="mb-3">The Microsoft Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge (MCAC), which is designed to encourage research relating to various problems in Collaborative AI, builds on a Minecraft mini-game called “Pig Chase”. Pig Chase is played on a 9 &times; 9 grid where agents can either work together to catch the pig and achieve high scores, or give up cooperation and achieve low scores. After playing certain episodes (e.g., 100) of games, the agent who achieves the highest average scores wins the challenge. Despite its simple rules, this game has all the above stated key characteristics. Though there are numerous papers studying sequential decision making in complex multiagent systems, they only address a subset of these characteristics. We hope to shed some light on solving this class of problems by presenting HogRider, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/malmo-collaborative-ai-challenge-winners/">a champion agent which won 2017 Microsoft Malmo Collaborative AI Challenge</a>. </p>
                      <p class="mb-3"> The solutions underlying HogRider are characterized by

                      <p class="mb-3">The number of software vulnerabilities disclosed every year is staggering, leading to increasing risks for system security officers. Because patching is expensive (time for patch installation time, patch purchase and risk of disruption to production systems), many vulnerabilities go unpatched because of limited resources to tackle thousands of patching tasks. 
To help alleviate the situation, when a new vulnerability is discovered, a <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE)</a> numbering authority (such as the <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE Coporation</a>) assigns a CVE number to that vulnerability, along with a brief description. The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> then studies the CVE and releases a severity score as well as its associated attributes (e.g., attack vector, attack complexity) via the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). However, we have observed that on average, it takes NIST around 130 days to conduct the investigation and analysis. In this project, we extract online discussions (e.g., Twitter) of the vulnerabilities, and predict i) when a vulnerability will be exploited, and ii) how severe that vulnerability is.</p>
